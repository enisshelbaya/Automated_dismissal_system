As the title suggests this is an Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund program I made.
there is no AI or trading Algortihm in this program. I made it so that I can get used to working with pandas and jupyter notebook.
I also tried my hand at some documantion but quit half way. This program uses yfinanace to retireve stock data of the s&p 500, and based on our calculation we procede to put in order using the alpaca trade api
