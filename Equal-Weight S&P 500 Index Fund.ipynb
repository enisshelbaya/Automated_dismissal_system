    "So I decided to use two diffrent API for retriving markert data and for trading in orders. yfinance allows us to access a ton of stock metrics, over 200 infact, in a very simple way. Of corse the down side being that we can't subit orders or sell. For that we are going to use the alpaca-trade-api. Alpaca has a free tier version that allows us to sell and purchases stocks, but their stock mertrics are absoultuly horendus. You can only view 5 diffrent metrics, and you can't request any information about stocks\n",
    "within 15 minutes. Basicly your only allowed to viwe historical data witj alpaca. So these two api complement each other well and fill each api gaps. Great!\n",

    "# yfinance is not an official API\n",
    "yfinance mainly makes API calls to Yahoo Finance to gather it’s data, but it does occasionally employ HTML scraping and pandas tables scraping to unofficially gather the information off the Yahoo Finance website for some of it’s methods. As such, the functionality of some of it’s methods is at the mercy of Yahoo not changing the layout or design of some of their pages. In fact, yfinance is widely known to already have a few issues."
